/*Perfect numbers are the sum of their true divisors, such as 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 or 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. The next perfect numbers are 496, 8128, 33550336, 8589869056, 137438691328, and 2305843008139952128.
Write an algorithm that prints all perfect numbers up to 100,000,000 (i.e., 6, 28, 496, 8128, 33550336) to the console.*/
